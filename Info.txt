Information
--------------------------------------------------

This repository is dedicated to projects I've made that I feel are good enough to show to others.
Currently I have a GrowingArray which is an array that allocates memory as you need more, there's still optimizations and improvements to be done but it's good enough for now.
The other project is an Image Blurring program that runs some versions of the Gaussian Blurring for TGA-images.
